# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Routing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize React Router for page navigation between Configuration, Prompts, and Results pages using Vite React TypeScript template
# Details:
Install and configure React Router DOM with TypeScript types. Create three main routes: /config, /prompts, and /results. Set up basic layout with navigation using Shadcn/UI components. Update package.json with react-router-dom dependency. Create route components in src/pages/ directory with proper TypeScript interfaces. Configure Vite for optimal routing.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between pages works correctly, URLs update properly, and TypeScript compilation passes without errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and configure React Router DOM with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install react-router-dom package and its TypeScript types, update package.json
### Details:
Run npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom to add routing dependencies. Verify installation and ensure TypeScript types are properly recognized by the project configuration.

## 2. Create pages directory and route components [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create src/pages/ directory with ConfigurationPage, PromptsPage, and ResultsPage components with proper TypeScript interfaces
### Details:
Create src/pages/ConfigurationPage.tsx, src/pages/PromptsPage.tsx, and src/pages/ResultsPage.tsx as functional components with TypeScript. Each should export a default component with proper interface definitions for props. Include basic page structure and placeholder content.

## 3. Set up React Router with BrowserRouter and main routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure BrowserRouter in main.tsx and create route definitions for /config, /prompts, and /results
### Details:
Wrap the App component in BrowserRouter in src/main.tsx. Create Routes and Route components in App.tsx for the three main pages: /config (ConfigurationPage), /prompts (PromptsPage), and /results (ResultsPage). Include proper TypeScript imports and route typing.

## 4. Create navigation layout with Shadcn/UI components [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Build a navigation header/layout component using Shadcn/UI Button components for routing between pages
### Details:
Create src/components/Layout.tsx component with navigation using Shadcn/UI Button components and Link components from react-router-dom. Include navigation for Configuration, Prompts, and Results pages. Use consistent styling with existing Shadcn/UI button variants and proper TypeScript interfaces for navigation props.

## 5. Configure Vite for optimal routing and update App.tsx [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Update Vite configuration for client-side routing and integrate Layout component with route structure
### Details:
Update vite.config.ts to include fallback routing for SPA mode (historyApiFallback). Refactor App.tsx to use the Layout component and wrap route definitions properly. Ensure the routing structure supports both development and production builds with proper TypeScript configuration.
