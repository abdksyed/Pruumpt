# Title: Add Responsive Design and Mobile Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure application works well on different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI responsive components
# Details:
Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes and Shadcn/UI responsive components. Ensure configuration forms built with Shadcn/UI, results table, and navigation work on mobile devices. Use responsive grid layouts and appropriate Tailwind breakpoints. Leverage Shadcn/UI's built-in responsive design patterns and TypeScript for component prop validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test application on various screen sizes, verify usability on mobile devices, and ensure Shadcn/UI components respond properly to different viewports

### Description: Update configuration forms to use responsive Tailwind grid classes and Shadcn/UI form components that adapt to different screen sizes
### Details:
Modify configuration forms to use responsive grid layouts with Tailwind classes like 'grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3'. Ensure Shadcn/UI form components (Input, Select, Button) scale properly on mobile using responsive padding and font sizes. Implement responsive spacing between form elements using Tailwind spacing utilities like 'space-y-4 md:space-y-6'. Use responsive button sizes from Shadcn/UI button variants ('size-sm' on mobile, 'size-default' on desktop).

## 3. Create responsive results table with horizontal scroll and mobile optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement a responsive table component for experiment results that handles overflow gracefully on mobile devices
### Details:
