# Task ID: 14
# Title: Add Basic Experiment History
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement simple local storage of recent experiments for user convenience with TypeScript data structures
# Details:
Store recent experiments in localStorage with TypeScript interfaces for data serialization. Save configurations and results with proper type definitions. Add simple UI using Shadcn/UI components to view and reload previous experiments. Limit storage to prevent excessive browser storage usage with TypeScript-enforced data validation and cleanup logic.

# Test Strategy:
Verify experiments are saved locally with proper TypeScript type safety, can be retrieved correctly, and Shadcn/UI components display history appropriately
