# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance and Bundle Size
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement performance optimizations and ensure fast loading times using Vite optimization features
# Details:
Implement code splitting for pages using React.lazy with TypeScript dynamic imports. Optimize bundle size by analyzing dependencies using Vite's bundle analyzer. Add performance monitoring for API calls and rendering with TypeScript performance interfaces. Implement React.memo and useMemo optimizations where appropriate with proper TypeScript typing. Leverage Vite's build optimizations and tree shaking capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Verify application loads quickly using Vite's optimized builds, performs well with multiple configurations, and TypeScript compilation is optimized for production

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code Splitting with React.lazy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up code splitting for pages using React.lazy with TypeScript dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size
### Details:
Create lazy-loaded components using React.lazy() and dynamic imports. Add React.Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks. Implement TypeScript interfaces for lazy components. Set up route-based code splitting in main routing logic. Configure proper error boundaries for failed lazy loads. Use Vite's dynamic import() syntax to enable automatic code splitting.

## 2. Configure Vite Bundle Analyzer and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Vite bundle analyzer to analyze dependencies and configure build optimizations for tree shaking
### Details:
Install rollup-plugin-visualizer for bundle analysis. Configure Vite build settings for optimal tree shaking by setting build.rollupOptions.treeshake to true. Add build.sourcemap for production debugging. Configure build.minify with terser options for better compression. Set up build.chunkSizeWarningLimit and implement manual chunk splitting strategy for vendor libraries. Create npm script for bundle analysis.

## 3. Implement Performance Monitoring Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add performance monitoring for API calls and rendering with TypeScript performance interfaces
### Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces for performance metrics (PerformanceMetrics, APICallMetrics, RenderMetrics). Implement performance monitoring utilities using Performance API and User Timing API. Add performance measurement hooks for component rendering times. Create API call performance tracking with request/response timing. Implement memory usage monitoring. Set up performance data collection and reporting infrastructure with proper TypeScript typing.

## 4. Apply React Optimization Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3
### Description: Implement React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback optimizations with proper TypeScript typing throughout the application
### Details:
Identify components that would benefit from React.memo optimization and wrap them with proper TypeScript component types. Add useMemo for expensive calculations and complex object creations with TypeScript return type inference. Implement useCallback for event handlers and callback props with proper TypeScript function signatures. Add performance profiling to identify re-render issues. Create TypeScript utility types for memoized components and callbacks. Document optimization patterns and performance impact.

## 5. Optimize Build Configuration and Production Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.4
### Description: Leverage Vite's build optimizations including production settings, asset optimization, and TypeScript compilation
### Details:
Configure production build settings in vite.config.ts with optimized build.target for modern browsers. Set up asset optimization including image compression and font loading strategies. Configure TypeScript compilation for production with optimal target and module settings. Implement preloading strategies for critical resources. Set up build.rollupOptions.output for optimal chunk naming and caching. Configure build.assetsDir and build.outDir for optimal deployment structure. Add build analysis scripts and performance budgets.
